# poe filter tool

Quickstart for building Path of Exile filters with shared sections and custom sounds.

This tool is currently built with leveling filters in mind. Any Contributions are very welcome.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- An IDE or editor of your choice (recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set your Path of Exile filter folder in `.env`.

```env
FILTER_PATH="C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile"
```

3. Copy the [`src/filters/template`](src/filters/template) folder to a new folder under `src/filters/`.

The template's `config.ts` exposes every configurable section with inline examples. The filter layout is already wired up, so you only edit configuration values; `npm run export-all` skips the template itself.

4. Edit your new filter's `config.ts`.

For most standard filters, `config.ts` is the only file you need to touch. `index.ts` usually only needs changes if you want a different section layout or custom logic.

5. Export your filter.

If your filter folder is `src/filters/yourfilter`, run:

```bash
npm run export yourfilter
```

> **Breaking changes:** When a sound pack update changes the folder name (e.g. `poeft-sounds` → `poeft-sounds-v2`), exporting overwrites your existing `.filter` file which now references the new sound folder. A warning is printed before export if an existing filter file is found. To keep your old filter working alongside the new one:
>
> - Rename the old `.filter` file in your Path of Exile directory, **or**
> - Rename your filter source folder under `src/filters/` (e.g. `yourfilter-v2`) to produce a differently-named filter file.

This regenerates typed item/sound files and syncs the sound pack before exporting. On first export (or when sounds are missing) sound files are generated automatically.

To export every tracked filter under `src/filters/` in one go, run:

```bash
npm run export-all
```

## User Overrides

If you want personal shared defaults or styles for all filters you can add local override files.

- Create `src/filters/shared/user-defaults.ts` to override shared defaults
- Create `src/filters/shared/user-styles.ts` to override shared styles
- Both files are gitignored, so they stay local to your machine

Example files are included here:

- [`src/filters/shared/user-defaults.example.ts`](src/filters/shared/user-defaults.example.ts)
- [`src/filters/shared/user-styles.example.ts`](src/filters/shared/user-styles.example.ts)

These overrides are merged on top of the committed shared defaults and styles automatically.

## Sounds

Filter rules use `.tts("Six Link")` to play a custom alert sound. The tool supports two kinds of TTS sounds:

- **Manifest sounds** — defined in `src/sounds/manifest.ts`. These are the canonical sounds for shared filter sections (currency drops, flasks, links, etc.). Their filenames are derived from the `id` field (e.g. `chaos_orb.mp3`), so you can edit the spoken text without breaking existing filters.
- **Ad-hoc sounds** — any text string passed to `.tts("My Sound")` in a user filter config. The filename is derived from the text itself and is regenerated on export.

### Generating sounds

Generate all manifest and ad-hoc MP3s at once:

```bash
npm run generate-sounds
```

### Cleaning up stale sounds

When you change or remove TTS entries, old `.mp3` files can accumulate. Clean them up with:

```bash
npm run clean-tts
```

### Sound pack syncing

Exported filters reference a `poeft-sounds-v2/` folder next to your `.filter` file so sounds don't collide with other tools. The export step copies the repo sounds there automatically.

Example:

```text
Path of Exile/
  Example.filter
  poeft-sounds-v2/
    chaos_orb.mp3
    six_link.mp3
    ...
```

To sync sounds manually:

```bash
npm run sync-sounds
```

If you want a different folder name, set `SOUNDS_FOLDER` in `.env`:

```env
FILTER_PATH="C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile"
SOUNDS_FOLDER="my-sounds"
```

## Generation

Run these commands when you want to refresh generated files after changing local assets:

```bash
npm run generate-types
npm run generate-sound-types
```

## Notes

- Most config fields have autocomplete for Path of Exile item classes, base types and link patterns
- `soundFile("...")` also gets typed sound filename suggestions for literal filenames
- Custom filter folders under `src/filters/` are gitignored by default
- `src/assets/BaseTypes.csv` comes from the public FilterBlade assets repo and can be refreshed locally with `npm run update-basetypes`
- A GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/update-basetypes.yml` checks upstream weekly and opens a PR when the CSV changes
